# Footy Hub

1. Premiere League
2. La Liga
3. Bundesliga
4. Serie A
5. Ligue 1

# API

We are using the API of football-data.org, which you can reach [here](https://www.football-data.org/documentation/quickstart). The free version is enough to suffice for the usage of the app.

# How to Use

Clone the repository using this command:
`git clone https://github.com/3arii/FootballHub.git`
Login to get the X-Auth-Token of the API with this [link](https://www.football-data.org/documentation/quickstart).
Replace the X-Auth-Token in the JS code:
`const X_Auth_Token = process.env.TOKEN;`
with the string form of the token you get.

# Furthering

If you enjoy the styling and simplicity of the webpage, you are more than welcome to develop this project further!
